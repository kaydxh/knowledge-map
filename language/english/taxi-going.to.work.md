## Take a taxi to work
I come out of my apartment.
It's ranning. No, it's pouring!
I forget to bring an umbrella.
I'd better to take a taxi.
I enter my destination on the ride-hailing app.
I hope I can get a ride in time.
I usually choose the premier type of car.
I prefer a comfortable ride.
I open the backdoor and get into the car.
It isn't cheap. But it is money well spent.
The driver speaks politely.
He ask me to put on my seatbelt.
I must do what he says to keep safe.
