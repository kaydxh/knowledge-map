## introduction at work 
So who am I?
My name is Kay.

I am a project manager.
In other words, I'm responsible for everything in my project.
My company is located in suburban Beijing.
It's 40-minute drive from my downtown apartment.
The offices are bright and airy.
The working environment is second to none.
My colleagues are highly driven people.
They are prepared to go above and beyond.
That's why I love working here. 
We are a great team.
