## Cycling to work
I unlock my new bike.
Riding a bike is a good way to get some exercise.
I put on my helmet and get on my bike.
It's important to ride safely.
I'm full of energy.
I try to speed up.
I feel free!
But soon I start to sweat.
I'm too tired to keep going.
I decide to walk the rest of the way.
Cycling might not be my thing. 
It take me another thirty minutes to get to the office.
How often should I ride to work?
Perhaps never.
