# Drive to work
I fasten my seatbelt and turn on the engine.
It's my first time driving to work.
I reverse my car and drive away.
It feels so good to drive.
I always let the pedestrians pass first.
I consider myself a polite driver.
It's important to obey the traffic rules.
No need to rush. Safety first.
I always keep a safe driving distance.
It helps to avoid tailgating.
I park my car and lock it.
I'm ready to work.
