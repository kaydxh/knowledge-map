## handover at work 
My boss is talking to my colleague.
He is probably leaving his job.
I'm trying to avoid eye contact with my boss.
Please don't pass his work to me.
Unfortunately, it is not my call.
I have no idea about this new project. Can I say no ?
Not a chance. The boss is setting a deadline for me.
I guess I have to bite the bullet.  
I'm struggling to come up with a new solution.
I should call everyone on our team and start brainstorming.
I'm racing against time.
I'm not giving up.
I'm checking very detail befor handing in the plan.
I'm not best but I'm trying my best.
