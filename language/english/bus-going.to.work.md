## Take a bus to work
I walk to the bus stop.
Oh! My bus is arriving.
I run toward it.
I have to catch it right now.
I get on the bus and pay with my phone.
Right on time.
I'm looking for an empty seat.
There is hardly any space in the back.
Execute me! Can I get by?
The company shuttle bus is waiting at the next stop.
I get off the bus and jump on the campany shuttle bus.
This is wasting too much time.
Maybe I should buy a car.


# Extension

The new trains shuttle passengers across the town.
