## shopping after work
It's been ages since last time I cooked.
I need to buy some groceries on my way home.
I made a shopping list and headed to the nearest store.
With the list, I'm less likely to double back.
I grabbed a shopping cart.
Let's get rolling.
First is the produce section.
Vegetables are packed with vitamins, and help us stay healthy and strong.
Then comes the meat and dairy setion.
Don't forget cheese and milk.
Next is the bakery and then the deil.
Wow, I'm lucky to get a bargain.
I've been checking the things off my list.
Keeping track is the key to shopping quickly.
I've been waiting at the checkout counter for 10 minutes.
Finally, it's my trun.
