## restaurant after work
I've made a reservation for two in the restaurant.
I was hoping to treat my friend tonight.
The waiter showed me to my table.
My friend hasn't arrived yet.
I've been waiting for her for ten minutes.
I wonder if she's got my message.
After a while, she finally showed up.
I guess she was stuck in traffic.
The waiter brought us a menu.
Let's see what they have got here.
We ordered their signature dishes.
They should be great.
We have finished everything.
The food here is out of this world.
I paid the bill with a credit card and signed the receipt.
What a wonderful dinner!
