## exercise after work
I've been working for ten hours.
It's time to take a break and go to the gym.
The first thing is to warm up.
It's vital to start slow.
I ran on the treadmil for 15 minutes.
I've already sweated a lot.
I've done three sets of push-ups and pull-ups.
It helps to build my strength.
I've done some barbell exercises to build muscle.
Come on! You got this.
I finished my training with stretching.
Cooling down is a must.
I've tried really hard to overcome my laziness.
It's all about not giving up.
I took a shower and changed my clothes.
I feel great after the workout.
