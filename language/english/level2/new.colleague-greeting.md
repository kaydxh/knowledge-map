## greeting new colleague
Excuse me. You dropped your work card.
Oh, thank you so much. I'm such a klutz.
I don't think we've met. You must be new.
Yes. I just joined the company. I'm Doris.
My name is Young.
Have you worked here long?
I have worked here for 2 years as a manager in the IT department.
Where did you work before?
I worked at an education company.
I was responsible for designing classes.
It's really nice to meet you.
Can I add your WeChat?
Sure.
Here is my QR Code.
I sent you a friend request.
I like your profile picture.
Thank you.
Oh no!
Is that the time already?!
I need to dash.
Don't let me hold you up.
Let's keep in touch on WeChat.
Would you like to have lunch together later?
That sounds good.
I'm looking forward to it.
