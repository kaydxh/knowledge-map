## ask the way
Hi, Doris.Do you know any good restaurants? I want to try someting new after work.
How about hotpot? Are you a fan of it? // what about 终究、怎么样
I love it. Do you know where a good one is?
Yes. I used to go to a really good one all the time. It's not far from here. I can't remember the Chinese name, but it's next to a Wal-Mart.
Let me check. I found two locations. Which one is it?
I think this location. My Chinese isn't so good, but it should be right.
I need to go out from Exit B.
Ok. I need to walk along the street and turn left at the traffic light. The hotpot restaurant should be around the conrner.
I've arrived. Here is the Wal-Mart, but where is the hotpot restaurant?
There's only a spa. It must have been the other location after all
Oh well, I'm here now!
