## asking after someone 
Those must be our drinks.
The weekend is almost here.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
I'm going to Shanghai.
Oh? Why?
There's a special event I must take part in.
That will be nice.
Yes, it will be.
It's my best friend wedding.
I'm so excited.
How long have you known each other?
We go back a long way.
So you are really close, right?
Yes, we are.
What about you?
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I'm gonna visit my friend.
She has just had an operation.
Oh really? Is she Ok?
Yes, it was just a minor operation, but I want to go and see her anyway.
You sound like a good friend.
Please send her my best wishes.
Well, I need to go home and pack my things.
See you in the office on Monday.
See you!
