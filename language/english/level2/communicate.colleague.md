## asking abount recent situations 
What are you doing, Doris?
I'm struggling to find my lunch card.
Did you go to the Lost and Found?
I did, but it wasn't there.
It has been a bad morning.
Why? What happened?
I left my laptop at home.
Oh no. What did you do?
I went home and picked it up.
But that wasn't the end of my bad morning.
On the way back to the company, I was riding a bike and it started to rain.
It rained cats and dogs.
It sounds terrible.
Wait.You haven't head the worst part.
At lunch, many pepole were waiting in line.
When I got to the front of the line, I realized my lunch card was missing.
Well, let me help you find it.
Oh, look. What's this?!
Where was it?
It was right under your nose.
Thanks a lot! Now, I can finally go for lunch.
