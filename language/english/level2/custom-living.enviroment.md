Hi, Leo. What are you doing?
I'm just looking at all of the different countries on this globe.
Isn't it amazing how big the world is?
Yes.I'm trying to learn more different customs and fun facts about the world.
Me too. I read a fun fact about time zones the other day.
Oh, really?
Do you know that in both Russia and America, they have 11 different time zones? But in China, we only have one: Beijing Time.
Wow! I didn't know they have so many time zones.
Yes, it's crazy!
I can't wait to go traveling again. The last time I went traveling, I noticed something interesting.
What's that?
The floor numbers are different in different countires. In the UK, we call the "first floor" of a building the "ground floor", the "second floor" of a building the "first floor".
Oh, really? It's good to learn more about the world we live in.
I'm still getting used to the difference here. I'm sure it will take some time.
That's funny.
