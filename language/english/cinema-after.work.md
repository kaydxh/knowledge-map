## cinema after work
A lot of new movies came out last weekend.
I'd like to go to the cinema tonight.
I wanted to book a ticket online.
Should I go for an Action movie or comedy?
The tickets were selling out quickly.
I have trouble making decisions.
I got to the cinema before the rush hour.
Wow, the theater is already full of people.
I printed out my ticket and had it checked.
I can't wait to watch the movie.
People were checking their phones all the time.
Is it difficult to put your phone down for two hours?
The movie failed to tell a good story.
I feel disappointed.
I left early.
It's a total waste of time and money.
