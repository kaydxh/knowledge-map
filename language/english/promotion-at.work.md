## promotion at work 
I've got a headache because of work stress.
I'm not myself today.
I check my work emails as usual.
I've got an email from our boss. How strange!
It turns out that I've got a promotion. 
I nailed it!
My boss and my teammates shake my hand to congratulate to me.
I can't tell you how hapyy I am!
It looks like I've got the chance to expand my team.
I've got several marketing people, but I haven't got any content creators.
I decide to start with talent mapping.
I hope to find the right people as soon as possible.
It's my first time clocking out so early.
I've got great plans for tonight.
I'm gonna celebrate!
