## work
I go to the employee lounge to get some coffee.
I can't live without my morning coffee.
I open my agenda to see today's work.
I don't like to start the day without a plan.
I hurry up to the project meeting.
I mustn't be late.
During the meeting, I usually give a project update and get feedback.
Meetings are helpful to spot and solve problems.
I often encourage my coworkers to speak up.
I never limit myself to just one point of view.
During lunch break, I get out for some fresh air.
An interview is scheduled for the afternoon.
At the end of the day, I write a short work report and plan for tomorrow.
Let's call it a day.
